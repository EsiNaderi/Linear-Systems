# Linear-Systems
This is a MATLAB code for inversion of linear systems. This code is developed based on the follwoing paper which is available on arXiv:


Inversion-Based Output Tracking and Unknown Input Reconstruction of Square Discrete-Time Linear Systems


It is an illustrative code. It is neither general nor optimal, and it does not cover all aspects of the paper.
